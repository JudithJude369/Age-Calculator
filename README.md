## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project really thought me alot, especially in the aspect of using vanilla javascript to build projects. I learnt how to remove and add classList and also perform some styles in javascript for the active class. It helped me learn how to validate form using vanilla javascript.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I hope to build more with vanilla Javascript, and hopefully improve my javascript knowledge and responsive design with CSS.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp]https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This freecodecamp fullstack curriculum is helping me understand Javascript.
